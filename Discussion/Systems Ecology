Central theme is to see ecology as complex adative system.

Current scenario : If our means of investigation became more and
more incisive, we would discover the simple under the
complex, then the complex under the simple, then again the
simple under the complex, and so on, without being able to
predict which state would ultimately prevail’’ - H Poincaré

Computational Ecology started with Predator Prey Model with ongoing research in Individual based modelling.
Involves incorporating complexity and variability at across levels- spatial- temporal and organizational.
The level of detail needed is still being studied upon. Too much resolution makes the study intractable. 
The aim is to remove sub grid level heterogeneity still maintainingg the overall predictability of the macroscopic properties. This could be 
done by building mathematical equations explaining the phenomenon whilst taking into account the primary granularity.

The level of complexity needed can be understood by looking at the dynamics between the components. 
Taking a case of Food Webs
Structure : Variety of species, interconnections or interactions and strength of the interaction.
Dynamics : Reslience and Stability of the system in response to various degree of perturbations.

The aim of these models would be to generate patterns that ecologists observe (Species- area curves, Species-Rank abundance curve)
The requirement then would be restrict the large parameter space and build more realistic models and develop methos which interace the 
mathematical analysis and numerical simulations.
