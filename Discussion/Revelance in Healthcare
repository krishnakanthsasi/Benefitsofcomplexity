Notes:
Discussion of three fundamental themes.
  
  Viewing heathcare organizations as complex adaptive systems:
    Replaces the view of them as top-down linear, prescriptive hieracrachial structures to something part of 
    a connected web of interacting agents embedded in larger networks and systems.
   
  Complexity in reviewing leadership roles:
    Control is replaced by management within context.
    "The consequences from the random actions of interacting agents in a healthcare system of slim resources
      often make healthcare leaders feel like they are living in a world of earthquakes, not trends."
    
  Complexity in pratice, research and teaching frontiers:
    "A physician who acts within the spirit of a
    complex adaptive system views the patient as
    a human organism, not an indication for a
    procedure; understands the patient is embedded
    in a variety of systems—physiological, family,
    political, and social—that continuously recalibrate
    themselves; and appreciates that small
    interventions at the correct leverage points can
    have large results."
    
 The highlight of the source article in recalibrating the view of controlled planning healthcare has to more holistic 
 approach based on complexity science
