Notes:
Complexity

Different kinds: Descriptive, ontological, as implied in complex adative systems.
Limitations of simplication and Newtonian Reductionism

Influences:
Paradigm shift in modelling.
Bridging modern and post modern sciences.
Solves a wide array of "midrange" everyday problems.

Features:
Mutlipicity (Very large number of units)
Interactions (Interdependence)
Diversity (or heterogeneity)

Measuring complexity
Hierarchy
Emergence
Self Organization

Vs previous models
Understanding a living system vs a machine
Differences in approaches to studying and understanding it.
Differences in the way forecasting is done.
